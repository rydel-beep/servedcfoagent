## 2026-06-16 — Chat 404 fix (Issue A)

1. **Replacement model = `claude-sonnet-4-6`.** The dead string `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
   was the dated ID for Sonnet 4, retired 2026-06-15. `claude-sonnet-4-6` is the documented
   drop-in for retired Sonnet 4 — same tier, keeps `temperature` support so the existing
   `temperature=0.5` call is unaffected. Chose the like-for-like Sonnet tier over jumping to
   Opus to keep cost/latency unchanged; Opus is one env-var flip away (`CHAT_MODEL`).

2. **Config-sourced, not hardcoded.** Added `CHAT_MODEL` to `config.py` (the documented home
   for all env vars) with a valid in-code default, read via `from config import CHAT_MODEL`.
   Rationale: the original bug was only possible because the string was hardcoded with no env
   override — centralising prevents recurrence and lets the model be bumped without a code
   deploy.

3. **No live "ping" test against candidate model strings.** The model catalog is authoritative
   and the retirement date (2026-06-15) matches the 404 symptom exactly, so a probe was
   unnecessary. Also avoided making a live API call so as not to touch the (masked) API key.

4. **Did NOT set the Railway `CHAT_MODEL` env var yet, and did NOT push/deploy.** The in-code
   default already fixes the 404 on deploy, so the env var is optional hardening. Pushing to
   production + setting prod env vars is an outward, hard-to-reverse action; per the project
   rule "show diffs before committing" and production-safety norms, this is gated on Rydel's
   explicit go rather than done autonomously. Diff shown; awaiting greenlight.

5. **Scope held to Issue A.** Hard-stopped before Issue B (Sheets freshness) per the work
   order's phase gate.
